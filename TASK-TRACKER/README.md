# Ujwal's Task Tracker

## 📖 The Story Behind the App
I was struggling with my daily management and I wouldn't be able to manage my daily tasks. Everything was so messy! That is why I decided to create a task tracker web app with vibe coding, to bring order and clarity back to my day-to-day life and manage my tasks effectively.

## ✨ Features
- **Task Tracking**: Easily organize your tasks across different statuses (Not Started, In Progress, Done).
- **Priority Management**: Assign priority levels (High, Medium, Low) so you always know what to work on first.
- **Time Estimation vs Actual Time**: Keep track of how much time you expect a task to take versus how long it actually took.
- **Detailed Dashboard**: A comprehensive dashboard built with fully interactive charts that map your overall efficiency, time variances, and task breakdown.
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Sort through your tasks intuitively by Date, Task Name, and Priority. Or use the specific filters and search bar provided.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Adding a Task**
   - Click the **"＋ New Task"** button on the top right.
   - Enter your task details: Date, Priority, Task Name, and current Status.
   - Optionally add your Estimated Time (e.g., `2h`, `45m`, `1.5h`) and Actual Time once completed to take advantage of the dashboard's analytics!

2. **Managing & Editing Tasks**
   - Quickly mark a task as Done by clicking the checkbox located at the beginning of each task row on the **Tasks** tab.
   - Click **"✏️ Edit"** on any task to update its details, log the Actual Time, or add additional notes.
   - Click **"🗑️ Del"** to remove a task.

3. **Analyzing Your Performance (Dashboard)**
   - Click on the **"📊 Dashboard"** tab.
   - View your metrics: Total Estimated time vs Total Actual time, Time Variance (under or over-estimation), Efficiency Rate, and the number of Overdue tasks.
   - Check out the intuitive pie charts and line graphs to see visual trends in your workflow!

4. **Running Locally**
   This application utilizes a simple vanilla stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and uses your browser's local storage to save your tasks persistently. 
   - No complex installation required! Just double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.
   - Alternatively, you can run a local web server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000`) and access the app via `http://localhost:8000`.
